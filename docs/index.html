<h1>irm<em>ir</em>cmd</h1>

<p>Implementation of irMagician command mimicking bto<em>ir</em>cmd</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>This is software for Ubuntu.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>install libusb and libjson-c for build. </p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt-get install libjson-c3 libjson-c-dev
</code></p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<h3>Receive infrared remote control</h3>

<p>When the reception of the infrared remote control succeeds, it is output to the standard output in JSON format.</p>
